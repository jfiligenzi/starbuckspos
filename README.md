# starbuckspos
This application is designed to allow for Starbucks employees to get better acquainted with
drink recipes and the processes behind making them. Along with the goal for future development of 
mimicking the POS allowing for practice with customer connection and engagement.

This software is to be used in a training setting along with allowing users to implement their own
personal drinks if they're struggling with anything. This software is new in its field as there is no
training software available to new Starbucks that is hands on like the real thing.

Current working features:
- open from data file
- save to data file
- JavaFX GUI to read off drink recipes
- ArrayList format for data
- UML file included
- Sorting feature to find drinks
